# My cis194 Haskell course work

Yorgey's cis194 course is apparently
[the recommended way](https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell#primary-courses)
for programmers to learn Haskell.

This repo contains my solutions to the homework exercises in this
course. So far I'm liking the pace of this course much better than
LYAH.
